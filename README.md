# call (503) 427-1565 now!

You can see who has called/texted lately, [here](http://feminist-phone.herokuapp.com/).

I really love [Feminist Phone Intervention](http://feminist-phone-intervention.tumblr.com/). Here is why I made my own:

*  I like javascript better than PHP
*  I like heroku, and I wanted it to be easier to deploy
*  I want this to be a general framework for phone-trolling apps
*  I wanted to make an instructional base for simple express/sockets/AngularJS/twilio telephony app, with realtime updates.
*  I wanted to log calls & texts for maximimum LOL

# support

Help pay for the phone-line by donating to [125ZumCPPxokALadXZZTiVWmVia1KizSFv](https://blockchain.info/address/125ZumCPPxokALadXZZTiVWmVia1KizSFv) bitcoin address. Twilio is pretty cheap, but when more calls roll in, it will get more expensive. I currently spend $20 a month of my own cash, and then it will stop working that month.

# quick start (for your own number)

*  Go to [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and create a free number, look for your SID & TOKEN in your dashboard, and set them in your [configuration](#configuration) (see below)
*  Go to [heroku](https://heroku.com/) and create a free host
*  Install [npm](http://nodejs.org/) & [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
*  `npm install` on command-line, in this directory
*  `heroku create` on command-line, in this directory
*  `heroku addons:add mongolab` on command-line, in this directory
*  `heroku labs:enable websockets` on command-line, in this directory
*  Edit configuration (see [configuration](#configuration) section below)
*  Deploy on heroku with `git push heroku master`

## configuration

The app is configured with environment variables. You can edit a file `.env`, or use heroku environment vars (in settings.)

### .env

An example `.env` file looks like this:

```
MONGOLAB_URI=mongodb://<SECRET>

TWILIO_SID=<SECRET>
TWILIO_TOKEN=<SECRET>
```

If you are using heroku, create the initial file, like this: `heroku config:pull --overwrite --interactive`

To push up your twilio config vars from `.env`, use `heroku config:push --overwrite --interactive`


# development

## milestone 1

*  Feature-parity with original
*  ~~basic documentation~~
*  ~~log texts & calls to mongodb~~
*  ~~output incoming texts/voice for display on site~~

Here are the features I intend to clone:

*  ~~incoming text responds with text quotes~~
*  ~~incoming call responds with TTS of text quotes~~
*  incoming call responds with pre-recorded MP3's


## milestone 2

*  feminist chat AI for honeypotting creepers into wasting their time. Get inspiration from [here](http://www.personalityforge.com/)
*  possibly (mildly) harass incoming texts with periodic texts/calls back
*  good documentation
*  multiple telephony backends (maybe some of the heroku addons for convenience)
*  quote admin interface: so you can set the quotes easily.
