I really love [Feminist Phone Intervention](http://feminist-phone-intervention.tumblr.com/), but wanted to make my own that runs on other deployment servers easier (I like heroku) and uses nodejs instead of PHP. This is a place-holder for when I have enough time to work on it.

## Milestone 1

*  Feature-parity with original
*  good documentation

Here are the features I intend to clone:

*  incoming text responds with Bell Hooks quote
*  incoming call responds with TTS of Bell Hooks quotes or pre-recorded MP3's


## Milestone 2

*  record incoming texts/voice for display
*  feminist chat AI for honeypotting creepers into wasting their time. Get inspiration from [here](http://www.personalityforge.com/)
